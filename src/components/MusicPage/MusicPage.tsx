            <h2>What kind of music do I make?</h2>
            <p>I really make whatever I feel like. If I feel like making something along the lines of electro swing, I’ll make it. If I feel like making glitch hop, then I’ll go for it. If I feel like making an orchestral work, then I’ll work on it. It’s really whatever I feel inspired to make, classical or electronic. I guess that kind of makes me a jack of all trades :P I usually make my own songs, but when I feel inspired to, I remix game soundtracks.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I’ve always played piano, and picked up other instruments such as alto saxophone along the way. Piano will always be my favorite instrument though. :) Although I’ve performed and competed a lot, I’ve also composed for a very long time since I was quite little, and it has always been a hobby of mine (definitely more fun than practicing haha). When I began writing on Noteflight (I really don’t recommend it to anyone anymore), I picked up the name “Turtlejam”, a combination of my favorite animal and a jam in the musical context. Now, I use Ableton Live for audio production and Musescore for notation software.</p>
            <p>I began my Youtube channel as a means of saving my compositions in a reliable space, but now I also use it to share my work with the world. I also have a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/TurtlejamMusic/">Facebook page</a> (https://www.facebook.com/TurtlejamMusic/) and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://soundcloud.com/elias-cho-3">SoundCloud account</a> (https://soundcloud.com/elias-cho-3) where I put my works.</p>
