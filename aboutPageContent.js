I\u2019ve always been interested in math and programming, so computer science is kind of like having both at the same time (and yes I do mean the mathematical branch). Graph theory is definitely my favorite topic in this. :D In my freetime, I usually spend time on competitive programming, developing some sort of project like a game or this website, or learning about something new in this field. I\u2019ve recently taken up an interest in machine learning and data science. It\u2019s another cool bridge between the two worlds! And I guess it can also lend itself to art too in terms of data visualization. And then maybe I can analyze audio data to make a bridge with music\u2026 oh boy."
